<h1>Programming</h1>
<p>On my programming project, I learned to code with Html, CSS, and P5 Javascript. I have decided to make a cube and a torus rotate around itself. What was Challenging about this project was to understand how the coding works. Coding respects strict rules you can’t  overpass otherwise your code won’t be effective. I enjoyed learning more about coding and it was a pleasant experience to create a program.
