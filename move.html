<h1>Seyana's in her feeling</h1>
<p>I have decided to animate my character. My character is myself. I have decided to make a 10 second animation by making my character cry. I am a very sensitive person and I cry very easily, that is why I decided to make my character cry. I also think that expressing your feeling is something important, and by crying you relief yourself. To shape the tears I used the pen tool, it was pretty easy because I worked with the pen tool on a previous project. I approached the timing pretty easily since it was a 10 second presentation. I really loved using after effects, I found it pretty easy and simple to understand. I didn't have anything that really challenged me during this project, on the contrary, I really loved it. The animation project was pretty interesting. </p>
